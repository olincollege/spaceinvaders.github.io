## Project Goals
  Our goal for this project was to implement a python version of the classicgame space invaders. Our primary focus was insuring that the collision mechanisms between characters and bullets reflect properly as well as the motion of the enemies. To stay true to the classic, we decided to keep the same top view however we decided to take out the barriers. Above anything else, our biggest goal was to ensure the players have fun!
## Game Overview
  Space Invader is a top down shooter game. Once the game is started, the enemies will appear on screen and the player will be able to move and shoot. The objective of the game is to kill all of the enemies without recieving any damage or allowing them to touch you (as you are one shot). Once all enemies are killed, the player wins the game and the game ends.
